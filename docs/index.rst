Introduction
------------

Telemetry Streaming (TS) is an iControl LX Extension delivered as a TMOS-independent RPM file. Installing the TS Extension on BIG-IP enables you to declaratively aggregate, normalize, and forward statistics and events from the BIG-IP to a consumer application by POSTing a single TS JSON declaration to TS’s declarative REST API endpoint. The supported third-party consumers include:

-  Splunk
-  Azure Log Analytics
-  AWS CloudWatch
-  AWS S3
-  Graphite

For a list of supported consumers and their example configurations, see :doc:`setting-up-consumer`.
