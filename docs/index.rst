Introduction
------------

Telemetry Streaming (TS) is an iControl LX Extension delivered as a TMOS-independent RPM file. Installing the TS Extension on BIG-IP enables you to declaratively aggregate, normalize, and forward statistics and events from the BIG-IP to a consumer application by POSTing a single TS JSON declaration to TSâ€™s declarative REST API endpoint. The supported third-party consumers include:

-  Splunk
-  Azure Log Analytics
-  AWS CloudWatch
-  AWS S3
-  Graphite
-  Kafka
-  ElasticSearch
-  Sumo Logic
-  StatsD

You can use Microsoft Visual Studio Code to validate your declarations, see :ref:`validate` for information.

This guide contains information on downloading, installing, and using the Telemetry Streaming Extension.
