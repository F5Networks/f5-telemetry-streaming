Push Consumers
==============

Use this section to find example declarations and notes for supported push-based consumers. See :doc:`pull-consumers` for pull-based consumers.

.. IMPORTANT:: Each of the following examples shows only the **Consumer** class of a declaration and must be included with the rest of the base declaration (see :ref:`components`).

Use the index on the right to locate a specific consumer.

|

.. _push:

Default Push Consumer
---------------------

This example shows how to use the default push consumer.  For the default push consumer, the type must be **default** in the Consumer class as shown.

The primary use case of such type of push consumer is troubleshooting.

Example declaration:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/declarations/consumers/default_consumer.json
    :language: json

.. _splunk-ref:

Splunk
------
|splunk_img|

Required information:
 - Host: The address of the Splunk instance that runs the HTTP event collector (HEC).
 - Protocol: Check if TLS is enabled within the HEC settings :guilabel:`Settings > Data Inputs > HTTP Event Collector`.
 - Port: Default is 8088, this can be configured within the Global Settings section of the Splunk HEC.
 - API Key: An API key must be created and provided in the passphrase object of the declaration, refer to Splunk documentation for the correct way to create an HEC token.

If you want to specify proxy settings for Splunk consumers in BIG-IP TS 1.17 and later, see the :ref:`Splunk Proxy<splunkproxy>` example.

.. NOTE:: When using the :doc:`custom endpoints feature<custom-endpoints>`, be sure to include **/mgmt/tm/sys/global-settings** in your endpoints for BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming to be able to find the hostname.

Additions to the Splunk consumer

.. _splunk-legacy:

Splunk Legacy format (Deprecated)
`````````````````````````````````
.. IMPORTANT:: The Splunk Legacy format has been deprecated as of BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming 1.17, and has entered maintenance mode. This means there will be no further BIG-IP TS development for the Splunk Legacy format. |br| We recommend using the :ref:`Splunk default format<splunk-ref>`, or :ref:`multi-metric`.

The **format** property can be set to **legacy** for Splunk users who wish to convert the stats output similar to the |splunk app|. To see more information, see |Analytics|. To see more information about using the HEC, see |HEC|.  See the following example.

To poll for any data involving **tmstats** you must have a Splunk consumer with the legacy format as described in this section.  This includes GET requests to the SystemPoller API because the data is not pulled unless it is a legacy Splunk consumer. |br| |br| BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming 1.7.0 and later gathers additional data from tmstats tables to improve compatibility with Splunk Legacy consumers.

In BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming v1.6.0 and later, you must use the **facility** parameter with the legacy format to specify a Splunk facility in your declarations.  The facility parameter is for identification of location/facility in which the BIG-IP is located (such as 'Main Data Center', 'AWS', or 'NYC'). 

If a Splunk Consumer is configured with the legacy format, then it ignores events from Event Listener.

Required information for **facility**: 
  - The facility parameter must be inside of **actions** and then **setTag** as shown in the example.
  - The value for **facility** is arbitrary, but must be a string.
  - The **locations** property must include ``"system": true``, as that is where facility is expected.
  - The value for facility is required when the format is legacy (required by the Splunk F5 Dashboard application; a declaration without it will still succeed)
  
Example Declaration for Legacy (including facility):

.. _multi-metric:

Splunk multi-metric format
``````````````````````````
.. sidebar:: :fonticon:`fa fa-info-circle fa-lg` Version Notice:

   Splunk multi-metric format is available in BIG-IP TS v1.17 and later, and requires Splunk 8.0.0 or later.

.. IMPORTANT:: Splunk multi-metric format requires Splunk version 8.0.0 or later.

BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming 1.17 introduced the ability to use Splunk multi-metric format (experimental in BIG-IP TS 1.17-1.24) for Splunk 8.0.0 and later.  Splunk multi-metric format allows each JSON object to contain measurements for multiple metrics, which generate multiple-measurement metric data points, taking up less space on disk and improving search performance.

See the |splunkmm| for more information.

.. WARNING:: Only canonical (default) system poller output is supported. Custom endpoints are NOT supported with the multi-metric format.

To use this feature, the **format** of the Splunk Telemetry_Consumer must be set to **multiMetric** as shown in the example.

Example Declaration for Splunk multi-metric:

.. IMPORTANT:: The Azure Log Analytics Consumer only supports sending 500 items. Each configuration item (such as virtual server, pool, node) uses part of this limit.

Additions to the Azure Log Analytics consumer
`````````````````````````````````````````````
The following items have been added to the Azure Log Analytics consumer since it was introduced.

.. list-table::
      :widths: 25 25 200

      * - BIG-IP TS Version
        - Property
        - Description
  
      * - 1.24
        - **format**
        - This was added to reduce the number of columns in the output which prevents a potential Azure error stating ``Data of Type F5Telemetry was dropped because number of field is above the limit of 500``. The values for **format** are:

      * - 
        - 
        - **default**: This is the default value, and does not change the behavior from previous versions. In this mode, each unique item gets a set of columns.  With some properties such as Client and Server SSL profiles, the number of columns exceeds the maximum allowed by Azure.  |br| For example, with a CA bundle certificate, there may be fields for expirationDate, expirationString, issuer, name, and subject.  BIG-IP TS creates a column named **ca-bundle_crt_expirationDate** and four additional columns for the other four properties.  The **name** value is a prefix for every column.

      * - 
        - 
        - **propertyBased** - This value causes BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming to create fewer columns by using the property name for the column.  In the example above, the column (property) name is just **expirationDate**, and all certificates use this column for the expiration dates.  |br| Note this happens only if the property **name** exists, and it matches the declared object name at the top. Otherwise, the naming mode goes back to default.

      * - 1.24
        - **region**
        - The **region** property for Azure Log Analytics and Application Insights was added in part to support the Azure Government regions. |br| - This optional property is used to determine cloud type (public/commercial, govcloud) so that the correct API URLs can be used (example values: westeurope, japanwest, centralus, usgovvirginia, and so on). |br| - If you do not provide a region, BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming attempts to look it up from the instance metadata. |br| - If it is unable to extract metadata, BIG-IP TS defaults to public/commercial |br| - Check the |azregion| for product/region compatibility for Azure Government. |br| - See the Azure documentation for a valid list of regions (resource location), and :ref:`Region list<azreg>` for example values from the Azure CLI.



To see more information about sending data to Log Analytics, see |HTTP Data Collector API|.

 - Passphrase: The secret to use when sending data to the system, for example an API key to be used in an HTTP header.
 - fallbackHosts: List FQDNs or IP addresses to be used as fallback hosts
 - proxy: Proxy server configuration


.. NOTE:: Since this consumer is designed to be generic and flexible, how authentication is performed is left up to the web service. To ensure the secrets are encrypted within BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming please note the use of JSON pointers. The secret to protect should be stored inside ``passphrase`` and referenced in the desired destination property, such as an API token in a header as shown in this example. 

Additions to the Generic HTTP consumer
``````````````````````````````````````
The following items have been added to the Generic HTTP consumer since it was introduced.


.. list-table::
      :widths: 25 25 200
      :header-rows: 1

      * - BIG-IP TS Version
        - Property
        - Description
  
      * - 1.18
        - **privateKey**
        - This and the following properties provide the ability to add TLS client authentication to the Generic HTTP consumer using the **TLS** authentication protocol.  This protocol configures BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming to provide the required private key and certificate(s) when the Generic HTTP consumer is configured to use SSL/TLS Client authentication.  |br| |br| **privateKey** is the Private Key for the SSL certificate. Must be formatted as a 1-line string, with literal new line characters. 

      * - 
        - **clientCertificate**
        - The client certificate chain. Must be formatted as a 1-line string, with literal new line characters. 

      * - 
        - **rootCertificate**
        - The Certificate Authority root certificate, used to validate the client certificate. Certificate verification can be disabled by setting allowSelfSignedCert=true. Must be formatted as a 1-line string, with literal new line characters.

      * - 1.29
        - **outputMode**
        - Possible values: **raw**, **processed**.  OutputMode provides the options to send data with the Generic HTTP consumer in an "as-is" (**raw**) format instead of the generated JSON payload (**processed**) allowing the data to be sent in Line Protocol format to a raw event listener and have it forwarded through the Generic HTTP consumer. 

      * - 1.31
        - **compressionType**
        - Sets the type of compression. The acceptable values are none for no compression (the default), or gzip, where the payload will be compressed using gzip. 

      * -  
        - **customOpts** experimental
        - This experimental feature relies on Node.js for each value when the user specifies nothing in **customOpts**.  Node.js values may differ based on version used. Refer to node.js documentation for more information.

|Google Cloud|

.. NOTE:: Google recently changed the name of their StackDriver product to Cloud Operations Suite with the monitoring product named *Cloud Monitoring*.

Required Information:
 - projectId: The ID of the GCP project.
 - serviceEmail: The email for the Google Service Account. To check if you have an existing Service Account, from the left menu of GCP, select **IAM & admin**, and then click **Service Accounts**. If you do not have a Service Account, you must create one.
 - privateKeyId: The ID of the private key that the user created for the Service Account (if you do not have a key, from the account page, click **Create Key** with a type of **JSON**. The Private key is in the file that was created when making the account). If you are using IAM roles, introduced in 1.25 do not use this property and see :ref:`gcmiam`.
 - privateKey: The private key given to the user when a private key was added to the service account. If you are using IAM roles, introduced in 1.25 do not use this property and see :ref:`gcmiam`.

For complete information on deploying Google Cloud Operations Suite, see |sddocs|.

**Finding the Data**  |br|
Once you have configured the Google Cloud Monitoring consumer and sent an F5 BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming declaration, F5 BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming creates custom MetricDescriptors to which it sends metrics.  These metrics can be found under a path such as **custom/system/cpu**. To make it easier to find data that is relevant to a specific device, BIG-IP TS uses the **Generic Node** resource type, and assigns machine ID to the **node_id** label to identify which device the data is from.

.. IMPORTANT:: There is a quota of 500 custom MetricDescriptors for Google Cloud Monitoring. BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming creates these MetricDescriptors, and if this quota is ever reached, you must delete some of these MetricDescriptors.

Using IAM roles for Google Cloud Monitoring
```````````````````````````````````````````
.. sidebar:: :fonticon:`fa fa-info-circle fa-lg` Version Notice:

   Support for GCP IAM roles is available in BIG-IP TS v1.25 and later

F5 BIG-IP Telemetry Streaming 1.25 added support for using IAM roles for Google Cloud Monitoring.  This means the Cloud Monitoring consumer can send data without specifying credentials if IAM roles are properly configured for the BIG-IP instance in GCP.

IAM roles are enabled by using the new **useServiceAccountToken** property set to **true** (the default is **false**).  When set to true, the **privateKey** and **privateKeyId** properties are not used. 

When using this feature, the authentication token is fetched from metadata at ``${METADATA_URL}/v1/instance/service-accounts/${serviceAccount.serviceEmail}/token``, meaning that **serviceEmail** in the declaration should match the service account email associated with the VM.
